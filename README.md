# css-js-bouncing-ball
A bouncing ball that changes color when button is clicked - a hit with 3 year olds when you want to show what mom does for work.

## Usefulness
Can be used as an introduction and a fun small assignment in combining CSS and Javascript.
It can be downloaded and altered or be used as inspiration for making something similiair from scratch.

**Added bonus:** Kids find it rather fun. Both watching a ball pop out of nowhere just from writing. As well as seeing it bounce and change color when clicking the button. 

**CSS and JS included / difficulty:**
* CSS variables
* CSS animation
* CSS gradient, filter and z-index
* JS Function
* JS DOM manipulation
* JS Variables
* JS switch case
* LOTS of comments
